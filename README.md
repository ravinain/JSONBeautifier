1. Install NodeJS, see https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Execute setup.bat to install http-server. Skip this step, if node_modules/.bin/http-server exists
3. Execute start-server.bat to start server
4. Execute npm run build command
4. Open http://localhost:8080/app/ . If this does not work check the port number, it should match with the port number showing in start-server.bat command window.
